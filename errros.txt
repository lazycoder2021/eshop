1. register/login error >> Verification/Passcode sent to mail msg appears, even when internet is not connected and therefore mail cannot be delivered -- this should be fixed (basically should look into sengrid api response and deliver the right message accordingly) 

2. modify login flow: once user verifies his or her account, then he should be asked to login again!!!!!! (not be allowed to go through app just like that!!) 

3. sendgrid mail not sent error >> if sendgrid fails to send mail, that error should be captured (api response) and shown to the user 

4. learn how get your app out of mongoose validation errors (when you get stuck in one): that is, 'path' review is required, 'email' is required etc. (basically mongoose error handling)
